# Deadly Enderdragon
Minecraft mod to make the Ender Dragon much more aggressive and dangerous without new mechanics.

Tuned perfectly for vanilla. You can finally stop chasing and start fighting. Be sure to enchant your gear with protection and pack some golden apples or similar health regen items. Also, don't get hit by the fireballs!

For mods/modpacks: All of its damage (including from effect amplifiers) now scales with the GENERIC_ATTACK_DAMAGE attribute. Similarly, its health regen now scales with GENERIC_MAX_HEALTH.
